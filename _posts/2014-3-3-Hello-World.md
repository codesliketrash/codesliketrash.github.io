title: You are really moving on with your life

This has been a rough year. I have been unemployed for all of it, and I cannot seem to make progress with the project of finding a new career. I have been living at the financial whim of my family and many times I use their money in an unethical way. Drinking myself into a 2 day hangover. How much time has gone by?
